## AI Use Case Intake & Risk Triage Workflow

### Problem
Enterprises often lack a consistent, auditable process for approving and governing AI use cases. Teams deploy AI quickly, while legal, security, and compliance are engaged too late.

### Solution
This project defines an enterprise AI intake and risk triage workflow that captures AI use case details, classifies risk, triggers governance controls, and produces an auditable decision trail.

### How the Workflow Operates
1. Business teams submit AI use cases through a standardized intake
2. Use cases are classified by risk level (low, medium, high)
3. Governance controls and approvals are triggered based on risk
4. Decisions and rationale are recorded for audit and oversight

### Risk Classification (Example)
- **Low Risk**: Internal productivity tools, no personal data, no automated decisions
- **Medium Risk**: Customer-facing AI, limited personal data, human-in-the-loop
- **High Risk**: Automated decisions, regulated data, safety or financial impact

### Frameworks & Standards
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- EU AI Act (risk tiers)
- ISO/IEC 42001
- Enterprise GRC best practices

### Business Value
- Faster AI approvals without sacrificing governance
- Reduced regulatory and compliance exposure
- Clear accountability across business, legal, and security teams
